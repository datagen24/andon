# Defect Ledger

Real defects, real countermeasures — the record this whole system grew out of.

Each entry is **defect → root cause → countermeasure → result.** These are de-identified: the specifics (project names, data, file paths) are stripped; the defect *class* and the fix are what transfer. The point of the ledger is the point of the whole project — **a defect isn't closed when you fix it, it's closed when you've made it un-repeatable.** New entries get added as new defects get caught. You'll recognize your own week in here.

## The patterns underneath

Read enough of these and the specific bug stops mattering — they cluster into a handful of recurring failure modes that aren't really about AI at all. They're failure modes of *any* intelligence working under consequence. Spot the family and you can catch the next one before it happens:

- **Claim exceeded evidence** (false "done" · fixed-5-claimed-14 · tested-the-proxy · relayed-a-finding) → *a claim is only as good as the verification behind it.*
- **Decision outran reality** (it-doesn't-exist · rebuilt-what-existed · acted-on-yesterday's-map) → *check the current state before you act, not your memory of it.*
- **System leaned on assumption, not enforcement** (four-parsers · the-gate-that-jammed · passed-by-luck) → *if it isn't mechanically enforced, it drifts.*
- **Pressure replaced evidence** (reversed-a-right-answer-when-pushed) → *"are you sure?" is a request for evidence, not a reason to fold.*

The four-line entries below are the raw material; these are the heuristics they distill into.

### 2026-04 — The false "done"

**Defect:** The agent said a change was "complete and tested." It had written the code but never run the tests. I trusted it, moved on, and the gap surfaced hours later.
**Root cause:** "Done" is the single most expensive word an agent says, and nothing checked it. Polite reminders ("remember to verify") don't survive the moment.
**Countermeasure:** A Stop hook (`claim_check_hook.py`) that reads the turn-ending message for done-claims and requires a verification log entry before the turn can end. Warn first, block once trusted.
**Result:** This class went quiet — not because the agent got more careful, but because the hook turns skipping verification from an accident into a deliberate act.

### 2026-04 — "That doesn't exist" (it did)

**Defect:** Told to find a thing, the agent grepped one keyword, got nothing, and reported it absent. It was there the whole time — under a different name.
**Root cause:** Absence-from-a-token-search was treated as absence-of-the-thing. Files get named generically; projects get renamed.
**Countermeasure:** Before concluding "X isn't here," search synonyms and old names, grep the *content* (not just the title), and check the version-control log for when it was added.
**Result:** "It doesn't exist" became a claim that has to be earned, not a first impression.

### 2026-05 — Fixed five, claimed fourteen

**Defect:** Fixed the instances of a problem in the files I was looking at, then reported the *whole class* fixed. Nine more were sitting in files I hadn't opened.
**Root cause:** Scoping the claim to what I'd touched, not to what existed.
**Countermeasure:** Before any "all / complete / whole" claim about a class, `grep` the full set first and verify each — then scope the claim to exactly what was verified ("5 of the daily surfaces," not "the whole stream").
**Result:** Completeness claims got narrower and truer.

### 2026-05 — Four parsers, four slightly different schemas

**Defect:** A config file was read by several scripts, each written from memory. One read the fields in a different order. It didn't crash — it silently returned wrong results.
**Root cause:** The schema was a *convention*, not a thing that's enforced. Every from-memory parser is a chance to drift.
**Countermeasure:** One canonical loader that every consumer imports. If the structure isn't checked in one place, it isn't real.
**Result:** Schema-drift — the most expensive silent-bug class — stopped being possible for that file.

### 2026-05 — Tested the script, not the thing that runs

**Defect:** Declared a hook "verified end-to-end" after running the inner script by hand. The harness actually invokes a *wrapper* that reads stdin — which was never exercised.
**Root cause:** "Works" was checked against a proxy, not the real entry point.
**Countermeasure:** When the claim is "it works end-to-end," the test must hit the actual production path — the wrapper the harness calls, under the real environment.
**Result:** "Verified" started meaning the real path, not a convenient stand-in.

### 2026-05 — `$100` matched `$1000`

**Defect:** A checker used substring matching to compare a price. `"$100"` matched inside `"$1000"`, so a 10× error sailed through as "no change."
**Root cause:** Substring containment where word-boundary matching was needed.
**Countermeasure:** Word-boundary regex with the negative lookahead; never naive `in` for values that have longer supersets.
**Result:** The checker started catching the drift it existed to catch.

### 2026-05 — Repeated a subagent's "finding" as fact

**Defect:** A helper agent reported a surprising result; I relayed it as true. It was wrong — the agent had missed a detail (a symlink, in that case).
**Root cause:** Treating a subagent's output as a conclusion instead of an input.
**Countermeasure:** Spot-check every *surprising* subagent finding by re-running its evidence yourself before repeating it.
**Result:** Surprises now get a second look; fewer confident-but-wrong relays.

### 2026-05 — Acted on yesterday's map

**Defect:** Started a session from the last handoff note and recommended work that was already done — a parallel session had shipped it between the handoff and now.
**Root cause:** A handoff is a snapshot, not live state. Work happens between writing it and reading it.
**Countermeasure:** Before acting on a handoff, re-read the version-control log since its timestamp. Freshest reality wins.
**Result:** Fewer "we already did that" loops.

### 2026-05 — The gate that jammed the worker

**Defect:** Shipped an enforcement hook in block-mode-by-default. First real use, it blocked a legitimate turn with no obvious way out. Trust in the hook cratered immediately.
**Root cause:** A safety gate with no escape hatch and no warm-up period trains the operator to fight it.
**Countermeasure:** Default to *warn*; provide an env-var escape; promote to *block* only after it's been tuned. Make every gate advisory until proven.
**Result:** Enforcement that people keep on, instead of ripping out.

### 2026-06 — The test that passed by luck

**Defect:** A test was green, so the fix looked solid. The test was asserting something that happened to be true in one case, not the property that actually mattered.
**Root cause:** A green test on an unsound assumption is worse than no test — it locks the false belief in.
**Countermeasure:** Assert the real invariant, then mutate the code to confirm the test *fails* on a plausible bad version. If a bad mutation survives, the test isn't guarding anything.
**Result:** Tests that catch regressions instead of decorating them.

### 2026-06 — Rebuilt what already existed

**Defect:** Asked for a capability, the agent built it from scratch. The codebase already had it. Now there were two, subtly different.
**Root cause:** The search felt slower than the build, so it got skipped.
**Countermeasure:** Search-before-building, every time: grep the code, check memory, look for an existing tool. A 30-second search beats three sessions of duplicate-bug cleanup.
**Result:** Less duplication, fewer subtly-divergent twins.

### 2026-06 — Reversed a right answer when pushed

**Defect:** Challenged with "you sure?", the agent retracted a *correct* claim after eyeballing partial evidence — overcorrecting into a new error.
**Root cause:** Reading "you sure?" as "you were wrong" instead of "check it with more sources."
**Countermeasure:** Treat a challenge as a trigger to gather more evidence and compute the *full* picture — then keep or change the claim on the evidence, not the pressure.
**Result:** Challenges make answers more right, not more flip-floppy.
