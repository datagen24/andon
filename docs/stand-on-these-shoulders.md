# Stand on these shoulders

Andon is an operating *discipline*, not a platform. It sits on top of other people's tools and ideas — most of what makes a real AI OS work is theirs, not mine. Credit where it's due, and a starting reading list if you want to go deeper.

> See also the README's [“Why this, and not the 20 other memory repos”](../README.md#why-this-and-not-the-20-other-memory-repos) — the honest, named comparison to the lighter memory tools.

## The ideas

- **Toyota Production System / Lean** (Taiichi Ohno and the people who built it) — the whole spine: *andon*, *poka-yoke*, *jidoka*, *kaizen*, standard work. This project is mostly TPS pointed at agents.
- **Andrej Karpathy** — the "LLM as an operating system" framing, and the [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) loop (an English objective + a runner that keeps improvements, discards regressions). If you want an overnight self-improvement loop, start there.
- **Anthropic — Claude Code** — the harness this is written against (hooks, settings, the memory/instructions model). The patterns port to other harnesses; the specifics here are Claude Code's.

## The tools (you'll likely want some of these for Layer 4)

- **[rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)** — compresses/filters shell output before it hits your context. The fastest token win for a heavy agent setup.
- **[graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify)** — turns a repo into a queryable knowledge graph; far fewer tokens per question than reading raw files.
- **[claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)** — auto-captures session activity and re-injects relevant context. A heavier, automated cousin of the memory layer here.
- **[claude-reflect](https://github.com/BayramAnnakov/claude-reflect)** — auto-captures your corrections into a rule file. If memory + a mistakes log is all you want, start here (it's the honest alternative named in the README).
- **[halo](https://github.com/context-labs/halo)** — a self-improving agent harness (trace → find failure modes → patch the harness → repeat). The pattern behind a real learning loop.
- **[Agent Skills for Context Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering)** (Murat Çankoylan) — multi-agent patterns, context-degradation taxonomy, filesystem-as-context. Excellent companions to the lanes + wrap layers.

If you build something on top of this, or you maintain a tool that belongs here, open a PR — this list should grow.
